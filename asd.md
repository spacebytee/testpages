"I AGREE!!!!!! THAT GUY STINKS!!!!!!!!!!" - miraclejack (10/7/2023 7:07PM EST)<br>
"Space deserves that username as [they were] the original creator of that username concept SpaceByte. I dont think the other person in instagram or tiktok should be having that username as they CLEARLY sniped it because they are opps with Space, overall i think the username change is needed so peace will be restored upon the social media platform. Plus, [they own] the username SpaceByte on discord and pretty much anywhere where someone didnt snipe their username." - upio, whom owns the handle "upio" on most major platforms (10/7/2023 7:22PM EST) <br>
